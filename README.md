# OmniAuth Basecamp

Basecamp OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0. Largely inspired by Shopify's OmniAuth strategy: https://github.com/Shopify/omniauth-shopify-oauth2

Totally inspired by corewebdesign OmniAuth gem for Harvest
https://github.com/corewebdesign/omniauth-harvest

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-basecamp'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

## Usage

Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions on using OmniAuth: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Other useful resources:
https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-oauth2
https://github.com/37signals/bcx-api

You will need to set up your application using 37signals integration portal `https://integrate.37signals.com/apps`.

To use this in Rails, for example, add the following in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :basecamp, ENV['BASECAMP_IDENTIFIER'], ENV['BASECAMP_SECRET']
end
```

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```json
{
  "provider": "basecamp",
  "credentials": {
    "token": "...I6MzRaIiwidXNlcl9pZHMiO...", // OAuth 2.0 access_token; use this for authenticating API requests
    "refresh_token": "...YyIsImFwYm9sdCI6IjQzYjN...",
    "expires_at": 1359624154,
    "expires": true
  }
}
```
